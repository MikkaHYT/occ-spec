        <h2>Green Energy Products</h2>
        <p>Solar Panels: Solar panels convert sunlight into electricity using photovoltaic (PV) cells. They can power homes, businesses, and even EV charging stations. Types of Solar Panels: Monocrystalline – High efficiency, long lifespan, more expensive; Polycrystalline – Moderate efficiency, lower cost; Thin-Film – Flexible, lightweight, lower efficiency. Key Components of a Solar System: Solar Panels – Generate electricity; Inverter – Converts DC to AC power; Battery Storage (optional) – Stores excess energy for later use; Net Metering – Allows excess energy to be sent to the grid for credits. Benefits of Solar Panels: Reduces electricity bills; Environmentally friendly; Increases property value; Works well with battery storage & EV chargers.</p>
        <p>EV Charging Stations: EV chargers supply power to electric vehicles (EVs), and they come in different levels. Types of EV Chargers: Level 1 (120V) – Standard home outlet, slow charging (3-5 miles per hour); Level 2 (240V) – Faster home or public charging (10-60 miles per hour); DC Fast Charging – Rapid charging for long trips (60-200+ miles in 20-40 minutes). Smart EV Chargers (Wi-Fi enabled): Can be scheduled to charge at off-peak hours; Monitors energy usage and integrates with solar power; Some models allow for vehicle-to-home (V2H) energy transfer. Installation Considerations: Requires dedicated electrical circuit; May need a professional electrician; Some states offer rebates & tax incentives.</p>
        <p>Smart Home Energy Management Systems: These systems optimize energy consumption, integrating solar, EV chargers, and battery storage to maximize efficiency. Key Features: Energy Monitoring – Tracks real-time electricity usage; AI & Automation – Adjusts energy consumption based on demand & pricing; Battery Storage Integration – Uses stored power when electricity rates are high; Grid Interaction – Sends excess solar power back to the grid; Smart Appliances & IoT Connectivity – Works with smart thermostats, lighting, and HVAC systems. Popular Smart Home Energy Management Brands: Tesla Powerwall + Gateway; Enphase Energy System; Schneider Electric Wiser; Sonnen Eco; Span Smart Panel. Benefits of Smart Energy Management: Reduces electricity costs; Optimizes solar & battery usage; Enhances grid independence; Improves home automation.</p>
